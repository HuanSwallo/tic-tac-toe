# Tic-Tac-Toe
A project where I used factory functions and module patterns work together to create a tic-tac-toe game using javascript.
# What I have learned
1. Use factory functions (multiple instance)
2. Use module patterns (single instance)
3. Start working with console first, then working with DOM
4. Creating 2-d arrays and working with them in javascript
